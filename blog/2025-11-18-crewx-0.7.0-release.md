## 🎯 Key Features

### Project Scaffolding

CrewX 0.7.0 introduces a **project template installation feature**. The `crewx template` command lets you retrieve AI agent configurations and project documentation all at once, allowing you to use CrewX immediately without complex setup processes.

```bash
# View available templates
crewx template list

# Install a template
crewx template init wbs-automation
```

More templates will be added in the future.

**Using Custom Template Repositories:**

You can also specify your own template repository using environment variables:

```bash
export CREWX_TEMPLATE_REPO=https://github.com/your-org/your-templates
crewx template list  # List templates from your repository
crewx template init my-custom-template
```

### First Template: wbs-automation

The **wbs-automation** template currently provided is designed to make it easy to get started with WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) based automated project management.

**Core Components:**
- `@coordinator` - WBS-based task coordination agent
- `wbs-loop.sh` - Automation script that runs the coordinator every 30 minutes
- `wbs.md` - Work Breakdown Structure document

**How It Works:**
1. `wbs-loop.sh` invokes the `@coordinator` agent every 30 minutes
2. Coordinator analyzes `wbs.md` to identify incomplete tasks
3. Distributes tasks in parallel to CrewX built-in agents like `@claude` and `@codex` based on task complexity
4. Automatically updates `wbs.md` with progress after each task completion

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install CrewX 0.7.0

```bash
npm install -g crewx@latest
crewx --version  # Verify 0.7.0
```

### Step 2: Install a Template

```bash
# Install the template
crewx template init wbs-automation

# Verify installed agents
crewx agent ls
```

### Step 3: Run Automation

```bash
# Create and edit wbs.md file (define your project tasks)
# Then run the automation script
./wbs-loop.sh

# Or manually invoke the coordinator
crewx x "@coordinator Check wbs.md and proceed with the tasks"
```
