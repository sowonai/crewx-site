CrewX 0.5.0 is here! This release introduces a **Skills system** compatible with Claude Code and a **Mention-Only mode** for Slack Bot.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Skills System - 100% Compatible with Claude Code

CrewX now supports a Skills system that lets you create reusable AI capabilities. **Skills are 100% compatible with Claude Code's format**, so you can use your existing Claude skills without any modifications.

#### Why Skills?

- **Reusability**: Create a skill once and use it across multiple agents
- **Compatibility**: Leverage the Claude Code skills library directly
- **Universality**: Works with Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Codex
- **Version Management**: Manage and deploy skills independently

#### Quick Start

**1. Create a Skill**

Create a `skills/hello/SKILL.md` file:

```markdown
---
name: hello
description: A skill that provides friendly greetings
version: 0.0.1
---

# Hello Skill

This skill provides friendly greetings to users.

## Features
- Generate personalized greetings
- Verify skills system functionality
```

**2. Configure in crewx.yaml**

```yaml
# Project-wide skills configuration
skills:
  paths:
    - ./skills              # Custom skills directory
  include:
    - hello                 # Specify which skills to use

# Add skills to specific agents
agents:
  - id: "senior_dev"
    provider: "cli/claude"
    skills:
      include:
        - hello
        - code-reviewer
    inline:
      prompt: |
        You are a senior developer.
```

**3. Use It**

```bash
# Run an agent with skills enabled
crewx query "@senior_dev hello"

# Test with multiple AI providers
crewx query "@skill_tester_claude test hello skill"
crewx query "@skill_tester_gemini test hello skill"
```

#### Use Claude Code Skills Directly

You can use skills from Claude Code's `.claude/skills/` directory without modifications:

```yaml
skills:
  paths:
    - ./.claude/skills    # Claude Code skills path
    - ./skills            # CrewX custom skills
```

No modifications needed, no copying required, just works! 🎉

### 2. Slack Mention-Only Mode

The Slack Bot now supports a **mention-only mode**. When enabled, the CrewX Bot only responds when explicitly mentioned.

#### Why You Need This

In the default mode, the Bot automatically responds to all threads in the channel. However, when team members are having conversations or asking quick questions, you may not always want AI chiming in.

#### Usage

```bash
# Start Slack Bot in mention-only mode
crewx slack --mention-only

# Start in regular mode (responds to all threads)
crewx slack
```

**How It Works:**

- **Regular Mode**: Bot automatically responds to all messages in threads
- **Mention-Only Mode**: Only responds when `@CrewX` is mentioned

```
# In mention-only mode
👤 "Can you review this code?"           → No bot response
👤 "@CrewX Can you review this code?"   → Bot responds! ✅
```

Now you can call AI assistance exactly when needed, enabling more efficient team collaboration.

## 📦 Other Improvements

- **Document System Refactoring**: More flexible document management in agent configurations
- **Performance Optimization**: Progressive loading of skills reduces memory usage
- **Stability**: Various bug fixes and improved error handling

## 🚀 How to Upgrade

```bash
# Update via NPM
npm update -g crewx

# Or reinstall
npm install -g crewx@latest

# Verify the version
crewx --version  # Should output 0.5.0
```

Your existing `crewx.yaml` configuration will continue to work as-is. To use Skills, simply add a `skills` section as described above.
