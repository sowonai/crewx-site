# Welcome to CrewX

Introducing **CrewX**, an innovative way to bring AI collaboration into your development team!

<!--truncate-->

## What is CrewX?

CrewX transforms your existing AI subscriptions (Claude, Gemini, Copilot) into collaborative development teams that work directly in Slack and your IDE.

### Key Features

ðŸ¤– **BYOA (Bring Your Own AI)**
- Leverage your existing AI subscriptions
- No additional costs
- Convert any CLI tool or AI service into an agent

ðŸ’¬ **Slack Team Collaboration**
- AI agents in your Slack workspace
- Thread-based context
- Real-time multi-agent collaboration

ðŸ”Œ **Pluggable Provider System**
- Universal AI integration
- Simple YAML configuration
- Mix and match multiple AI services

## Why We Built CrewX

Traditional AI tools isolate developers in separate chat sessions. Team knowledge gets siloed, and collaboration becomes difficult.

CrewX transforms this by:
- Bringing AI directly to your team channels
- Automatically maintaining conversation context
- Supporting collaboration between multiple AI agents
- Making AI expertise accessible to your entire team

## Get Started Now

```bash
npm install -g crewx
crewx init
crewx query "@claude analyze this codebase"
```

For more details, check out the [documentation](/docs/intro)!

## What's Next?

We're continuously improving CrewX with new features:
- Enhanced remote agents for distributed teams
- Advanced plugin integrations
- Improved context management
- Better IDE integration

Stay tuned for updates!
