# Welcome to CrewX

We're excited to introduce **CrewX** - a revolutionary way to bring AI collaboration to your development team!

<!--truncate-->

## What is CrewX?

CrewX transforms your existing AI subscriptions (Claude, Gemini, Copilot) into a collaborative development team that works directly in Slack and your IDE.

### Key Features

ðŸ¤– **Bring Your Own AI (BYOA)**
- Use your existing AI subscriptions
- No extra costs
- Transform any CLI tool or AI service into an agent

ðŸ’¬ **Slack Team Collaboration**
- AI agents in your Slack workspace
- Thread-based context
- Real-time multi-agent collaboration

ðŸ”Œ **Plugin Provider System**
- Universal AI integration
- Simple YAML configuration
- Mix and match different AI services

## Why We Built CrewX

Traditional AI tools isolate developers in separate chat sessions. Team knowledge stays siloed, and collaboration is difficult.

CrewX changes this by:
- Bringing AI directly into team channels
- Maintaining conversation context automatically
- Enabling multiple AI agents to collaborate
- Making AI expertise accessible to the entire team

## Get Started Today

```bash
npm install -g crewx
crewx init
crewx query "@claude analyze this codebase"
```

## What's Next?

We're continuously improving CrewX with new features:
- Enhanced remote agents for distributed teams
- Advanced plugin integrations
- Improved context management
- Better IDE integration

Stay tuned for updates!
